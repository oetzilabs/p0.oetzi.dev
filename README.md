## ROADMAP

- [x] List of Servers
- [x] Sessions and Actors
- [x] Terminal Rendering
- [x] Process Management
- [x] Project Management
- [x] Git Management
- [ ] Firecracker VM Management [Video Tutorial (DJ Ware)](https://youtu.be/As9LO6XBfkA)
- [ ] Initilizing the project via a `p0.config.ts` example file.

### Might consider this too

- [ ] I saw a few videos about `@effect/cluster`. Might want to use it for sharding and load balancing across servers. But I am unsure if that's the right fit for what I want to build.
