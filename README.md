## ROADMAP

- [x] List of Servers
- [x] Sessions and Actors
- [x] Terminal Rendering
- [x] Process Management
- [ ] Project Management (WIP)
- [ ] I saw a few videos about `@effect/cluster`. Might want to use it for sharding and load balancing across servers. But I am unsure if that's the right fit for what I want to build.
